# Ternary Search

Very basic algorithm. We have an [unimodal function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unimodality), and we want to find it's minimum (by definition of unimodality it will be the only local minimum).

In my code example the algorithm finds minimum of `x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0`, which will print:

```
Point of minimum: -2
Value at minimum: -6
```
